## Contributing translations

You can contribute to GitHub Readme YouTube Cards by adding translations in the `api/locale` folder.

To add translations for a new language:

- Copy the contents of `api/locale/en.yml` file to `api/locale/<IDENTIFIER>.yml`, where IDENTIFIER is shorthand for the language you are adding translations for.
- Change the top most yaml key `en:` to `<IDENTIFIER>:`.
- Add translations for the strings provided below in the file. Only alter the text enclosed in quotes.
- To test, run the project locally and add `&lang=IDENTIFIER` to a card URL to test if translation works as expected.
